PersonalityRPG (working title) is going to be a fun way to learn your INFJ personality through a simple text-based RPG game.

Current functionality is limited. Current version on GitHub has combat set up, but not effectively as of yet. 

Currently we have Kyleigh tackling our town talks, while Daniela is taking on the personality side of things. I am working on general systems.

Currently combat is simple, all enemies damage sponges for now.
