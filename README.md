PersonalityRPG (working title) is going to be a fun way to learn your INFJ personality through a simple text-based RPG game.

Current functionality is limited. Current version on GitHub has combat set up, but not effectively as of yet. 

Currently we have Kyleigh tackling our town talk aspect of the game, and Daniela is taking on the personality side of things. I am working on combat and emeny encounters (If it's not fun it's my fault).

Currently combat is simple, so any recommendations to add a bit of depth are appreciated.
