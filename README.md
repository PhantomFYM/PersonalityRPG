PersonalityRPG (working title) is going to be a fun way to learn your INFJ personality through a simple text-based RPG game.

Game can be played from beginning to end. Nothing currently happens if you reach the end.

Currently we have Kyleigh tackling our town talks, while Daniela is taking on the personality side of things. I am working on general systems.

Currently combat is simple, all enemies are damage sponges for now.
